## Environment 
Check your kernel level 
```bash
#uname -r 
4.18.0-372.32.1.el8_6.x86_64 
```
Nvidia drivers need to be installed for your specific kernel version. 
Precompiled kernel modules are availabe for the Nvidia drivers and have the advantage of being tested and validated against specific kernel versions. 
Look for your kernel version (in this example 4.18.0-372.32.1) in [Nvidia's precompiled kmod driver package table](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/rhel8/x86_64/precompiled/); locate the matching Nvidia driver version in the table.
The driver version and kernel verison string must match exactly.  If your kernel version is not in the Nvidia precompiled kmod driver package table you can use the Nvidia Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) package to generate linux kernel modules for the Nvidia driver. To install the Nvidia drivers with RHEL using DKMS follow [Nvidia's instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html). 


##Verify the GPU installed on your system
```bash
# lspci -nnv |grep -i nvidia![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3208719/206945570-cfc31532-2cb8-48fb-bf39-5447361df725.png)
